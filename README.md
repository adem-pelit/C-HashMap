# C-HashMap
This is a HashMap implementation in C programming language. Simply speaking it is a Collection struct which uses Key(char*) and Data pairs(void*). Each Key maps to a corresponding Value. In HashMap structure, reaching a Key and Data pair is faster than a normal list because of hashing system. In this HashMap impelementation, the struct of Hashmap has an array that given size. When you add a Key and Data pair, the pair must place in the element of this array thats index is calculated by Hashing function. But pairs can have same index. To prevent this causing a problem, every element of array contains a doubly linkedList and pairs that have same index is place in same list. In short, HashMap is a list that divided little into lists to reduce the cost of procedures.(Of course there are several different approach)
# CODE
## struct NODE
It is struct that contains the data. It has key(char*), data(void*), next and previous nodes.
## struct List
List is a struct that implements doubly linkedList. It contains NODE's to store the data.
## struct HashMap
HashMap struct has an array of List and size of the array.
## List* CreateList()
Creates a List and returns.
## del()
Deletes data by a key that given as a parameter.
## DelList()
Deletes List and every NODE in it
## NODE* Add()

## int dolas()

## NODE* find()
