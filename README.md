# C-HashMap
this is a HashMap implementation in C programming language. Simply speaking it is a Collection struct which uses Key(char*) and Data pairs(void*). Each Key maps to a corresponding Value. In HashMap structure, reaching a Key and Data pair is more rapidly than a normal list because of hashing system. In this HashMap impelementation, the struct of Hashmap has an array that given size. When you add a Key and Data pair, the pair must place in the element of this array thats index is calculated by Hashing function. But pairs can have same index. To prevent this occur a problem, every element of array contains a doubly linkedList and pairs that have same index is place in same list. In small words, HashMap is a list that divided little lists to reduce the cost of procedures.(Of course there is several different approach)
# CODE
## struct NODE

## struct List

## struct HashMap
